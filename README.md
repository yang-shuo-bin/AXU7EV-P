# Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC Series Development Board AXU7EV-P
## Introduction to Development Board
The entire structure of the development board is designed based on our consistent core board+extension board pattern. Core board and expansion board
High speed inter board connectors are used for connection. The backplane expands a variety of peripheral interfaces for the core board, including one FMC HPC, one M.2 SSD interface, and one
Road mini_ DP interface, 1 USB 3.0 interface, 2 Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, 1 FMC HPC interface, 1 40
Pin interface, 2-way UART interface, 1-way PCIEX8 gold finger, 1 EEPROM, 1 temperature sensor, and some buttons
